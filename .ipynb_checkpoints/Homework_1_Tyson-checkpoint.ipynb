    "Drew Conway is a data scientist famous for the Venn diagram that he created, explaining what data science is. If we were to create a Venn diagram on why Drew was interviewed for this book it would likely contain; region 1) Drew is a privileged white American male, making him statistically much more likely to go to top universities and onto highly regarded jobs;  Region 2) Drew excelled academically and was fortunate enough to end up in the data science field at a time that the field had barely been defined yet; Region 3) Drew drew a Venn Diagram that went viral. Again he was in the right place at the right time. A black swan event. Heâ€™s a lucky man."

    "1. Predict winners of NRL matches: obtain match statistic data, select variables (by mulitvariate regression?) and run a logistic regression to estimate win probabilities. Create model off pre-2016 data and test on 2016 results. Compare this to the Bookmaker odds to judge effectiveness of the model. (all data obtained)\n",
    "2. Predict try/goal scorers in games: obtain try scorer history data. Independant variables will likely be player's position, amount of trys scored previously (as a % of games played), teams bookmaker starting price. Id then like to run this as both a logistic regression and random forest to compare output. (all data obtained)\n",
    "3. Predict Customer value: At Williamhill, customers can most simply be labelled as good (profitable) and bad (unprofitable, likely professional bettors). Their initial behaviour (sign up channel, first market bet on, Whether first bets are on prices significantly above the starting price etc) gives many clues as to whether they are going to be profitable or not. goal: Use machine learning to predict whether new clients will be profitable/or losing. (some data obtained. Sensitive data)\n",
    "4. Predict likelihood of Website visitor clicking affiliate link: Use Google Analytcis data to predict likelihhod of website visitor clicking on an affiliate link. Random forest model. Use to value visitors via different channels/campaigns. (Website is under construction. no data available yet).\n",
    "5. Predict Hosuing Clearance rates: obtain data online and predict upcoming weekend clearance rates according to volume of avaliable sales, past weekends'performances, area house size etc. included economic idictor variables (GDP, unemployment rates, interest rates etc).\n"
